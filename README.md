# [JSL05] Submission: Galaxy Playlist Generator
# Challenges Faced:

Dynamic Playlist Generation: The main challenge was to generate playlists dynamically based on each guardian's preferred genre.

DOM Manipulation: Integrating the playlist generation logic with the DOM, ensuring it displays correctly.

Styling: Incorporating styles to make the playlists visually appealing and easy to read.

Before properly reading the instructions, I used html and css to make the playlist but eventually I fixed it by using DOM to manipulating the HTML. 

# Suggestions for Modifications:

Error Handling: Implement error handling for scenarios where the preferred genre of a guardian doesn't match any available songs.

User Interaction: Allow users to add their own preferred genres and dynamically generate playlists based on their input.

Enhanced Styling: Improve the styling to make the playlists more visually appealing, possibly adding album covers or play buttons.

Playlist Customization: Allow guardians to customize their playlists by adding or removing songs.

Optimization: Explore ways to optimize the code for better performance, especially for larger datasets.

Localization: If applicable, consider adding support for multiple languages in the interface.

By addressing these points, the code can be made more robust, user-friendly, and scalable.
