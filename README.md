# [JSL05] Submission: Galaxy Playlist Generator
# Challenges Faced:

# Dynamic Playlist Generation: The main challenge was to generate playlists dynamically based on each guardian's preferred genre.
The code dynamically generates playlists tailored to each guardian's preferred genre and displays them on the webpage.

# DOM Manipulation: Integrating the playlist generation logic with the DOM, ensuring it displays correctly.
Before properly reading the instructions, I used html and css to make the playlist but eventually I fixed it by using DOM to manipulating the HTML to ensure the correct display. 

# Styling: Incorporating styles to make the playlists visually appealing and easy to read.
The list style removal was used to remove the bullets from the list items to make the playlist more compact and visually apealing.
Margin for list items is used to the bottom of each list item, creating some space between them.
The playlist division class class is used to apply additional CSS styles to the playlist container.

# Suggestions for Modifications:

Error Handling: Implement error handling for scenarios where the preferred genre of a guardian doesn't match any available songs.

User Interaction: Allow users to add their own preferred genres and dynamically generate playlists based on their input.

Enhanced Styling: Improve the styling to make the playlists more visually appealing, possibly adding album covers or play buttons.

Playlist Customization: Allow guardians to customize their playlists by adding or removing songs.

Optimization: Explore ways to optimize the code for better performance, especially for larger datasets.

Localization: If applicable, consider adding support for multiple languages in the interface.

By addressing these points, the code can be made more user-friendly.
